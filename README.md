In this project of mine, I act as a business selling products for picnics, BBQs, and camping. As a picnic and BBQ business, we understand that a picnic is not just a relaxing occasion but also an opportunity to create lasting memories with family and friends. However, things don't always go smoothly, and one of the factors that determines the success of a picnic is the weather. Good weather can turn a picnic into a great experience, while bad weather can disrupt or ruin the whole plan.
With the goal of providing the best possible experiences to our customers, we have combined our picnic product business with research and analysis of weather data. This research not only helps us understand weather patterns better, but also enables us to make accurate recommendations to our customers on the best days for camping and what to pack. With this information, we can offer products such as tents, raincoats, moisture-proof mats, coolers, and many other tools to meet all needs, regardless of the weather conditions. Additionally, based on our weather analysis, we can develop weather-appropriate business strategies.
The skills demonstrated in this project are data cleaning, analysis and visualization using R. I also built a machine learning model to predict weather using Decision Tree Model.
The data source I used for analyze is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/weather-prediction
